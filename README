# ROSNeuro Visualizaer package

The package provides **neuroviz** stand-alone application to visualize **NeuroFrame** messages ([rosneuro_msgs](https://github.com/rosneuro/rosneuro_msgs)) published in a given topic. 


## Requirements
rosneuro_acquisition has been tested with the following configuration:
- **Ubuntu 18.04.05 LTS Bionic Beaver** and **ROS Melodic**
- **Ubuntu 20.04.02 LTS Focal Fossa** and **ROS Noetic**

rosneuro_acquisition depends on the following @rosneuro packages:
- [rosneuro/rosneuro_msgs](https://github.com/rosneuro/rosneuro_msgs) 
- [rosneuro/rosneuro_data](https://github.com/rosneuro/rosneuro_data) 

## Usage
The package acquires data from external devices and publishes it as a **NeuroFrame** message ([rosneuro_msgs](https://github.com/rosneuro/rosneuro_msgs)). Each published message represents a chunk of data as `samples x channels`. This defines a **framerate** according to which the data is published to other modules. For instance, if the device provides data at 512 Hz (sampling rate) and the acquisition is set to have a framerate of 16 Hz, each **NeuroFrame** will contains 32 samples (x channels) of data. For more information about **NeuroFrame**, please refere to the [rosneuro_msgs](https://github.com/rosneuro/rosneuro_msgs) documentation.
